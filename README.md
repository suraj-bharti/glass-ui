## üí° Example Usage

```vue
<template>
  <g-panel variant="primary" padding="lg">
    <h1>Welcome to Glass UI</h1>
    <g-alert variant="info" dismissible>
      This is an info alert!
    </g-alert>
    <g-button variant="success" @click="notify">Show Toast</g-button>
    <!-- Toaster should be mounted at the root or in App.vue -->
    <Toaster />
  </g-panel>
</template>

<script setup>
import { toast } from 'glass-ui-vue';

function notify() {
  toast.emit('show', {
    message: 'Hello from Glass UI!',
    variant: 'success',
    duration: 3000
  });
}
</script>
```

## üõéÔ∏è Using the Toaster: Two Approaches

Glass UI provides two ways to trigger toast notifications.  
Choose the one that best fits your use case:

### 1. Global Event Emitter (`toast.emit`)

**How:**  
Import the `toast` event bus and emit notifications from anywhere in your app.

```js
import { toast } from 'glass-ui-vue';

function notify() {
  toast.emit('show', {
    message: 'Hello from Glass UI!',
    variant: 'success',
    duration: 3000
  });
}
```

**When to use:**  
- You want to trigger toasts from any component, even deeply nested ones.
- You want a decoupled, global notification system.
- You don‚Äôt want to pass refs or props around.

**Note:**  
Mount `<Toaster />` once at the root (e.g., in `App.vue`).
 
---

### 2. Local Ref Method

**How:**  
Use a `ref` to the `<Toaster />` component and call its `show` method directly.

```vue
<template>
  <Toaster ref="toaster" />
  <g-button @click="notify">Show Toast</g-button>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { Toaster } from 'glass-ui-vue';

const toaster = ref(null);

function notify() {
  toaster.value.show('Hello from Glass UI!', { variant: 'success', duration: 3000 });
}
</script>
```

**When to use:**  
- You only need to show toasts from within a specific component or local area.
- You want more direct control or to avoid global state.
- You don‚Äôt want to rely on an event bus.

---

**Tip:**  
You can use both methods in the same app if needed!
