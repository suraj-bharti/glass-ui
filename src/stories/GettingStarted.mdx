# 🚀 Getting Started with Glass UI

Welcome to **Glass UI**, the Vue 3 component library that brings the magic of glassmorphism to your projects!  
Whether you’re building a dashboard, a landing page, or a full-featured web app, Glass UI helps you create interfaces that are modern, elegant, and a delight to use.

---

## ✨ What is Glass UI?

Glass UI is a thoughtfully designed set of Vue 3 components inspired by the glassmorphism trend—think frosted glass, soft shadows, and vibrant gradients.  
It’s more than just a collection of pretty elements: it’s a toolkit for building beautiful, accessible, and highly interactive user interfaces with minimal effort.

**Why choose Glass UI?**

- **Modern Aesthetics:** Every component is crafted with glassmorphism in mind, blending frosted backgrounds, soft shadows, and vibrant accents.
- **Vue 3 & Composition API:** Built from the ground up for Vue 3, leveraging the latest best practices and performance optimizations.
- **Customizable & Themed:** Easily switch between light and dark modes, or override SCSS variables to match your brand.
- **Accessible by Default:** ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast are all considered, so your apps are usable by everyone.
- **Developer Friendly:** Comprehensive documentation, Storybook previews, and TypeScript support make integration a breeze.
