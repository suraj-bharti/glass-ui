# üëã Welcome to Glass UI

## üåü Why Glass UI?

Glass UI is more than just a set of components‚Äîit's a design system that brings clarity, depth, and a touch of magic to your projects.  
With its glassmorphic effects, subtle blurs, and vibrant color overlays, Glass UI helps you create interfaces that feel both futuristic and inviting.

- **Modern Aesthetics:** Every component is crafted with glassmorphism in mind, blending frosted backgrounds, soft shadows, and vibrant accents.
- **Vue 3 & Composition API:** Built from the ground up for Vue 3, leveraging the latest best practices and performance optimizations.
- **Customizable & Themed:** Easily switch between light and dark modes, or override SCSS variables to match your brand.
- **Accessible by Default:** ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast are all considered, so your apps are usable by everyone.
- **Developer Friendly:** Comprehensive documentation, Storybook previews, and TypeScript support make integration a breeze.
